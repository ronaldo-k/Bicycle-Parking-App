# Bicycle Parking Facilities Map Application

## Proposal

The application is intended to provide cyclists with a map of nearby bicycle parking facilities, such as racks, lockers and parkades, given a specified address and to inform them of user-provided statistics regarding the security of each facility, including reports of theft of bicycles stationed at a given parking spot. Although cyclists will be the primary users, both those that use their bicycles for commuting and for sport, those that plan to install bicycle parking (such as business owners and transit and governmental agencies) can also use the application to register their facilities into the database.

As a cyclist, I find myself discouraged to use my bicycle for commuting and running errands due to the lack of secure parking infrastructure and apparently elevated levels of bicycle theft not only in most major cities. Taking this into consideration, this application's goal is to be a proof of concept of a piece of software that, if integrated with an actively updated database, could demonstrate the current condition of bicycle parking in major cities, motivating the adoption of cycling as a reliable, sustainable and healthy means of transport and the action on behalf of local government agencies to promote secure cycling and parking.
