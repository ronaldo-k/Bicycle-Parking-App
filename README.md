# Bicycle Parking Facilities Map Application

## Proposal

The application is intended to provide cyclists with a map of nearby bicycle parking facilities, such as racks, lockers
and parkades, given a specified address and to inform them of user-provided statistics regarding the security of each
facility, including reports of theft of bicycles stationed at a given parking spot. Although cyclists will be the
primary users, both those that use their bicycles for commuting and for sport, those that plan to install bicycle
parking (such as business owners and transit and governmental agencies) can also use the application to register their
facilities into the database.

Cyclists in large cities often find themselves discouraged to incorporate their bicycle as a means of 
transport for their daily activities due to the apparent high levels of theft and the inconsistent presence and 
security of end of trip and parking facilities. 
Taking this into consideration, this application's goal is to be a proof of concept of a piece of software that, if 
integrated with an actively updated database (which is outside the scope of the current project), could demonstrate 
the current condition of bicycle parking in major cities, motivating the adoption of cycling as a reliable, 
sustainable and healthy means of transport and the action on behalf of local government agencies to promote secure 
cycling and parking.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add my bicycle to my list of bicycles.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for parking facilities of a certain type near a given address.
- As a user, I want to filter a search query by type or characteristics (e.g. whether it is sheltered from the rain) of 
  the facility.
- As a user, I want to be able to see reports on the incidence of bicycle theft for a given parking facility.
- As a user, I want to be able to report that one of my bikes were stolen from a given parking facility.
